# Update
You no longer need to add coords. Just add the prop_name. 

#  Description
This is a criminal doctor script made with the ESX develop branch. 
PS: All coords are made exactly for me, so you might have to rewrite just that, however this will be fixed. Just have that in mind :D

# To-do
1. Make sure its "connected" to a bed prop and not an coord. --DONE
2. Optimizing code as usual
3. Make it better :D
4. Maybe a NPC Ped that spawns and actually treats you?

# What does it do?
Basically, its a doctor script. What more can I say..
You go whereever you need to go, press E and get healed. Only if you are hurt ofc.

# Reminder
Keep the cost HIGH, else players will use this more than a hospital.
