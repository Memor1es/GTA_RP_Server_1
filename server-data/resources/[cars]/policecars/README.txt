Well, here it is, my biggest pack to date and i'm very excited to release it. This is a pack i've been working on for about a month now and it's the result of the biggest amount of effort I've ever put into a pack.

Don't quote me on this but I think this may be the biggest non-els pack ever made, so that's kinda cool.

This pack is not based off any real life agency but does strictly adhere to a SoundOff Signal based setup.

Every vehicle in the pack features;

- SoundOff nForce lightbar, SoundOff interior lighting for slicktops.

- Every vehicle has a slicktop variant including an unmarked and marked livery.

- Fully custom carcols made by me with 100% accurate environmental lighting and colors.

- Custom liveries made by me.

- Most units have a PB5 style wraparound pushbar.

- Interiors with speed radar unit inlcuding antennas, MDT, detailed console, SoundOff nERGY 400 siren, gun rack, detailed ProGard partition, citation printer, radio unit, and truck equipment (In the back seat for trucks)

As usual I would highly recommend putting on a never dirty setting because they lightbars get fogged out by dirt/snow.

 I am not able to give installation instructions because I do not actually know how to install stuff to normal GTA, just FiveM. Sorry. Thanks for reading, and I really, really, hope you enjoy.
